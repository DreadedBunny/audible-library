window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second novel in Isaac Asimov’s classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series.</p> <p>Led by its founding father, the psychohistorian Hari Seldon, and utilizing science and&nbsp;technology, the Foundation survived the greed and barbarism of its neighboring warrior-planets. Now cleverness and courage may not be enough. For the Empire - the mightiest force in the Galaxy - is even more dangerous in its death throes. Even worse, a mysterious entity called the Mule has appeared with powers beyond anything humanly conceivable. Who - or what - is the Mule? And how is humanity to defend itself against this invulnerable avatar of annihilation?</p> <p>Filled with nail-biting suspense, nonstop action, and cutting-edge speculation, <i>Foundation and Empire </i>is the story of humanity’s perpetual struggle against the darkness that forever threatens to overwhelm the light - and of how the courage of even a determined few can make all the difference in the universe.</p>";
