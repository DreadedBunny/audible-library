window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As complex, turbulent and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, this novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale.</b><br> <br> “An enormously enjoyable book, full of wonderful aliens, a sense of wonder and subtle political commentary on current events.” –<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (Starred Review) <br> <br> It is 4034 AD. Humanity has made it to the stars. Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year.<br> <br> The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilization. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young and fighting pointless formal wars.<br> <br> Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of—part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony—Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer—a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known.</p> <p>“Banks is a phenomenon...writing pure science fiction of a peculiarly gnarly energy and elegance.” –William Gibson</p> <p>“Banks writes with a sophistication that will surprise anyone unfamiliar with modern science fiction.” –<i>The New York Times</i></p> <p><i>For More from Iain M. Banks, check out:</i><br> <br> <b>The Culture series:</b><br> <i>Consider Phlebas<br> The Player of Games<br> Use of Weapons<br> The State of the Art<br> Excession<br> Inversions<br> Look to Windward<br> Matter<br> Surface Detail<br> The Hydrogen Sonata</i></p>";
