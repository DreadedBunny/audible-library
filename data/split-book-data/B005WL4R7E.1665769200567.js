window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unsurpassed for their unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are one of the great masterworks of science fiction. With extraordinary vision, they chronicle the struggle of a courageous group of men and women devoted to safeguarding humanity against an unyielding deluge of barbarism and warfare.&nbsp;</p> <p>At last, the costly and bitter war between the two Foundations has come to an end. The scientists of the First Foundation have proved victorious; and now they return to Hari Seldon's long-established plan to build a new Empire on the ruins of the old. But rumors persist that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all - and that its still-defiant survivors are preparing their revenge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now two exiled citizens of the Foundation - a renegade Councilman and a doddering historian-set out in search of the mythical planet Earth.... and proof that the Second Foundation still exists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, someone - or something - outside of both Foundations seems to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose. Soon representatives of both the First and Second Foundations will find themselves racing toward a mysterious world called Gaia and a final, shocking destiny at the very end of the universe!</p>";
