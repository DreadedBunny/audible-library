window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In time for the 2020 presidential election, Anonymous returns to expand on their \"must read\" (</b><b><i>Time</i></b><b>), number-one best-selling behind-the-scenes \"scathing portrait\" (</b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b>) of the Trump presidency with new words of warning for Americans everywhere. </b></p> <p>On September 5, 2018, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> published a bombshell essay and took the rare step of granting its writer anonymity. Described only as \"a senior official in the Trump administration\", the author provided eyewitness insight into White House chaos, administration instability, and the people working to keep Donald Trump's reckless impulses in check. </p> <p>With the 2020 election on the horizon, Anonymous is speaking out once again. In this book, the original author pulls back the curtain even further, offering a first-of-its-kind look at the president and his record - a must-listen before Election Day. It will surprise and challenge both Democrats and Republicans, motivate them to consider how we judge our nation's leaders, and illuminate the consequences of re-electing a commander in chief unfit for the role. </p> <p>This book is a sobering assessment of the man in the Oval Office and a warning about something even more important - who we are as a people. </p>";
