window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\" (Royal Navy Motto) </p> <p>Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier <i>Ark Royal</i> was the pride of the Royal Navy. But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull. She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye. But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons. <i>Ark Royal</i> and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving.... </p> <p>And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?</p>";
