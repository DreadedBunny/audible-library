But first, they must get past themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you enjoyed <i>Solitude</i>, you'll love the action and plot twists in this apocalyptic epic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Vaughn had visions of plying the seven seas with Angela at his side. Then she and fate crapped all over his plans. Bent on discovering the truth about what happened to humanity and the rest of the world's life, Angela drags a less-than-willing Vaughn across the Mediterranean and into central Europe. However, even the overhead presence of a line of levitating steel structures and ships couldn't prepare them for what lied ahead. The size and scale of what they find in Geneva rocks them to their cores.&nbsp;</p> <p>Angela and Vaughn fall into the center of a world-consuming machine. While struggling to survive, they wander through a looping chain of utterly alien lands. When they finally deduce the true nature of their situation, Angela discovers a potential way out, not just for her and Vaughn but all of Earth's life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Angela can bring back the whole of the human race!&nbsp;</p> <p>But only if she and Vaughn can survive the journey home.</p>";
