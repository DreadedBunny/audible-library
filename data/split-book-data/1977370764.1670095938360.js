The Colony is composed of two insectoid species, the grays and the reds. They're aggressive three- and five-meter long insectoids with venomous pincers that live for the expansion of their race. The Pyreans already lost one member of their team on their first exploration and are hesitant to meet the Colony again, unless they're better prepared.</p> <p>Harbour and Jessie, her advisor, have an opportunity to demand a high price from the Tsargit through their negotiations with the Veklocks.
