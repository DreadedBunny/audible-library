window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BEST SELLER •&nbsp;The award-winning, best-selling author of </b><b><i>Station Eleven</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Glass Hotel</i></b><b> returns with a novel of art, time travel, love, and plague that takes the listener from&nbsp;Vancouver Island&nbsp;in 1912 to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a story of humanity across centuries and space.</b></p> <p><b>“One of [Mandel’s] finest novels and one of her most satisfying forays into the arena of speculative fiction yet.” —</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p>Edwin St. Andrew&nbsp;is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal—an experience that shocks him to his core.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn&nbsp;is on a book tour. She’s traveling all over Earth, but her home is&nbsp;the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive’s best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe.</p> <p>A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, <i>Sea of Tranquility</i> is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.</p>";
