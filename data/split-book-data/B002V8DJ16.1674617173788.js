window.bookSummaryJSON = "A masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to \"Our Father Below\". At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C.S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old Devil to his nephew, Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. <p><i>The Screwtape Letters</i> is the most engaging account of temptation, and triumph over it, ever written.</p>";
