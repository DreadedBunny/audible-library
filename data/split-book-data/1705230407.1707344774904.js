window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A team of space archaeologists makes an astonishing discovery about an ancient alien race in this science fiction tale from \"a master of his craft\" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Graduate student Tom Rice is thrilled to embark on his first deep-space archeological expedition. He is part of a team from Earth, venturing out in search of artifacts from a civilization that ruled the universe many millennia ago. Called the High Ones, the members of this long-gone society left tantalizing clues about their history and culture scattered throughout space. One such clue, a \"message cube\" containing footage of the ancient ones, is more interesting than all of the others combined. It seems to indicate that the High Ones aren't extinct after all - and just like that, Tom Rice's archeological mission has become an intergalactic manhunt, one filled with ever-increasing danger that will send the explorers hurtling headlong into the greatest adventure - and peril - of their lives.</p>";
