window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The saga of two young friends trapped in an endless nightmare of suspicion and surveillance, of cyber-programmed servants and a ruling class with century-long lives - and the enigmatic woman who dominates them all. Narrators Jonathan Davis and Gabra Zackman skillfully split up this sweeping sci-fi epic that is \"at once a psychological novel, a murder mystery, and an examination of power on a grand scale.\" (<i>Locus</i>)</p>";
