window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"This is a narrative that describes the urgency that compels me and millions more to push for a different American story than the one being told today. It's a story that is one part danger, one part action, and all true. It's a story about how and why we fight for our democracy and win.\"</b><br> <br> <b>This program is read by the author</b><br> <br> Celebrated national leader and best-selling author Stacey Abrams offers a blueprint to end voter suppression, empower our citizens, and take back our country. A recognized expert on fair voting and civic engagement, Abrams chronicles a chilling account of how the right to vote and the principle of democracy have been and continue to be under attack. Abrams would have been the first African American woman governor, but experienced these effects firsthand, despite running the most innovative race in modern politics as the Democratic nominee in Georgia. Abrams didn’t win, but she has not conceded. The audiobook compellingly argues for the importance of robust voter protections, an elevation of identity politics, engagement in the census, and a return to moral international leadership.<br> <br> <i>Our Time Is Now</i> draws on extensive research from national organizations and renowned scholars, as well as anecdotes from her life and others’ who have fought throughout our country’s history for the power to be heard. The stakes could not be higher. Here are concrete solutions and inspiration to stand up for who we are - now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company</b><br> <br> \"In a voice full of grace, warmth, and determination, politician and activist Stacey Abrams provides listeners with a road map for building a more just and democratic nation...In a clear, direct delivery, Abrams shares her message with the fire and poise of an inspiring public speaker. This audiobook is a call to action.\" (<i>AudioFile Magazine</i>)</p>";
