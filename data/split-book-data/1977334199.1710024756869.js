window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A jungle planet must defend against exploitative aliens in this novel by the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>From the rich imagination of science-fiction great Alan Dean Foster comes the story of Midworld, a Humanx Commonwealth planet that's equally fragile and hostile. Covered by a lush rainforest, Midworld is home to a primitive society that lives in harmony with the natural world. But the arrival of an exploitative human company, whose workers know nothing of Midworld's delicate ecosystem, sparks a conflict. Should Midworld's villagers aid the humans or stand against them? </p> <p>The hero of Foster's addictive pause-resister, Born, decides to lead two humans across the perilous jungle. His choice propels Midworld toward annihilation - and leads him headlong into a battle for survival.</p>";
