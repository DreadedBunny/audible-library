window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A gripping new scientific biography of the revered Nobel Prize–winning physicist (and curious character) Richard Feynman.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest physicist of the second half of the 20th century, Richard Feynman changed the way we think about quantum mechanics, the most perplexing of all physical theories. Here Lawrence M. Krauss, himself a theoretical physicist and best-selling author, offers a unique scientific biography: a rollicking narrative coupled with clear and novel expositions of science at the limits. An immensely colorful person in and out of the office, Feynman revolutionized our understanding of nature amid a turbulent life. From the death of Feynman’s childhood sweetheart during the Manhattan Project to his reluctant rise as a scientific icon, Krauss presents that life as seen through the science, providing a new understanding of the legacy of a man who has fascinated millions. An accessible reflection on the issues that drive physics today, <i>Quantum Man</i> captures the story of a man who was willing to break all the rules to tame a theory that broke all the rules.</p>";
