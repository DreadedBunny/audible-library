window.bookSummaryJSON = "In a future wracked by environmental catastrophe and social instability, physicist John Renfrew devises a longshot plan to use tachyons - strange, time-traveling particles - to send a warning to the past. In 1962, Gordon Bernstein, a California researcher, gets Renfrew's message as a strange pattern of interference in an experiment he's conducting. As the two men struggle to overcome both the limitations of scientific knowledge and the politics of scientific research, a larger question looms: can a new future arise from the paradox of a forewarned past? <p>Winner of both the Nebula Award and the John W. Campbell Award for best science-fiction novel, <i>Timescape</i> is an enduring classic that examines the ways that science interacts with everyday life to create the many strange worlds in which we live.</p>";
