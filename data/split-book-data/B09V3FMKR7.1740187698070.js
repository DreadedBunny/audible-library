window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Hugh’s imaginative worlds and tales within them never fail to entertain!”</p> <p><b>—Andy Weir, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Project Hail Mary</i></b></p> <p><b>The first original novel from author Hugh Howey in six years, </b><b><i>Across the Sand</i></b><b> takes us back to the world of </b><b><i>Sand</i></b><b>, to a far future many generations after a disaster has destroyed civilization as we know it, where four siblings struggle to build their futures amid the harsh wastes of endless desert.</b></p> <p><i>The old world is buried. A new one has been forged atop the shifting dunes, a land of howling wind and infernal sand.</i></p> <p>In this barren home, siblings Conner, Rob, Palmer and Violet daily carve out a future. They live in the shadow of their father and oldest sister, Vic, two of the greatest sand divers ever to comb the desert’s depths. But these branches of their family tree are long gone, disappeared into the wastes beyond, leaving the younger siblings scratching in the dust, hopeful for a better life.</p> <p>On the other side of No Man’s Land, Anya was born beside the abundant mines knowing her prospects would be to marry, have a family, and work in ore, in service to the Empire of the East. But when an atomic bomb delivered by a stranger destroys most of her town—murdering all her friends and community—she follows her father to a strange land of dunes to bring vengeance to their enemies.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
