window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Paul Bäumer is just 19 years old when he and his classmates enlist. They are Germany’s Iron Youth who enter the war with high ideals and leave it disillusioned or dead. As Paul struggles with the realities of the man he has become, and the inscrutable world to which he must return, he is led like a ghost of his former self into the war’s final hours. <i>All Quiet</i> is one of the greatest war novels of all time, an eloquent expression of the futility, hopelessness and irreparable losses of war. </p>";
