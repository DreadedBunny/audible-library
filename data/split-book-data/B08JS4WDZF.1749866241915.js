window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the Norman Invasion in 1066 to the eve of the First World War, <i>Stick a Flag in It </i>is a thousand-year jocular journey through the history of Britain and its global empire.</p> <p>The British people have always been eccentric, occasionally ingenious and, sure, sometimes unhinged - from mad monarchs to mass-murdering lepers. Here, Arran Lomas shows us how they harnessed those traits to forge the British nation, and indeed the world, we know today. Follow history’s greatest adventurers from the swashbuckling waters of the Caribbean to the vast white wasteland of the Antarctic wilderness, like the British spy who infiltrated a top-secret Indian brothel and the priest who hid inside a wall but forgot to bring a packed lunch. At the very least you’ll discover Henry VIII’s favorite a*se-wipe, whether the flying alchemist ever made it from Scotland to France, and the connection between Victorian coffee houses and dildos.</p> <p>Forget what you were taught in school - this is history like you’ve never heard it before, full of captivating historical quirks that will make you laugh out loud and scratch your head in disbelief.</p>";
