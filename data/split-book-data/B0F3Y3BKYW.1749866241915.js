Starring Caleb McLaughlin (<i>Stranger Things, The Deliverance</i>), who delivers a gripping performance in his Audible debut, <i>Sacrilege: Curse of the Mbirwi</i> (mBeerwee) plunges listeners into a world where ancient spirits collide with inner wounds and family secrets are as deadly as the strange beasts that stalk the savanna.</p> <p>Lost in his headphones, self-absorbed teen Dashon Wallace (McLaughlin) never imagined that a strained family trip meant to bring everyone closer could unravel so completely. But when he unwittingly desecrates hallowed ground, he unleashes the Mbirwi, a vengeful entity born from centuries of colonial oppression. As possessed wildlife and shape-shifting horrors close in, Dashon must confront not only the supernatural threat but also the horrors of his own past to save what remains of his family.</p> <p>Presented in spectacular Dolby Atmos, <i>Sacrilege</i> blends pulse-pounding suspense with profound explorations of identity and privilege to deliver a thriller as thought-provoking as it is terrifying.
