window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the immersive and intoxicating world of <i>The Outside</i>, comes the exhilarating sequel from Philip K. Dick Award-nominated author Ada Hoffmann. </p> <p>The laws of physics acting on the planet of Jai have been forever upended; its surface completely altered, and its inhabitants permanently changed, causing chaos. Fearing heresy, the artificially intelligent Gods that once ruled the galaxy became the planet’s jailers. </p> <p>Tiv Hunt, who once trusted these Gods completely, spends her days helping the last remaining survivors of Jai. Everyone is fighting for their freedom, and they call out for drastic action from their savior, Tiv’s girlfriend, Yasira. But Yasira has become deeply ill, debilitated by her Outside exposure, and is barely able to breathe, let alone lead a revolution. </p> <p>Hunted by the Gods and Akavi, the disgraced angel, Yasira and Tiv must delve further than ever before into the maddening mysteries of their fractured planet in order to save - or perhaps even destroy - their fading world.</p>";
