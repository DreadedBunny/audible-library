window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A lot has changed in 25 years. A quarter-century after the publication of his groundbreaking first book, Malcolm Gladwell returns with a brand-new volume that reframes the lessons of </b><b><i>The Tipping Point</i></b><b> in a startling and revealing light — this time in an immersive audio format that transports you, the listener, directly inside of each riveting story.</b><br> <br> Why is Miami… Miami? What does the heartbreaking fate of the cheetah tell us about the way we raise our children? Why do Ivy League schools care so much about sports? What is the Magic Third, and what does it mean for racial harmony? In this provocative new work, Malcolm Gladwell returns to the subject of social epidemics and tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of contagious phenomena.<br> <br> Through a series of gripping stories, Gladwell traces the rise of a new and troubling form of social engineering. As with his podcast <i>Revisionist History</i> and bestsellers <i>Talking to Strangers</i> and <i>The Bomber Mafia</i>, pressing play on this audiobook will bring each scene and story to life with vivid first-person accounts, captivating oral histories, illuminating moments from history past and present, and a cinematic original music score.<br> <br> Take to the streets of Los Angeles with Malcolm to meet the world’s most successful bank robbers, rediscover a forgotten television show from the 1970s that changed the world, visit the site of a historic experiment on a tiny cul-de-sac in northern California, and explore an alternate history of two of the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis. <br> <br> <i>Revenge of the Tipping Point</i> is Gladwell’s most personal book yet. With his characteristic mix of storytelling and social science, he offers a guide to making sense of the contagions of the modern world. It’s time we took tipping points seriously.</p>";
