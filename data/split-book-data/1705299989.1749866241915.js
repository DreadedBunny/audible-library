window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Short stories by a master of science fiction. Includes over a dozen stories by SF legend Jerry Pournelle, and remembrances by Pournelle collaborators and admirers. </b></p> <p>For the better part of five decades, Jerry Pournelle's name has been synonymous with hard-hitting science fiction. His Falkenberg's Legion stories and Janissaries series helped define the military SF genre, as did his work as editor on the There Will Be War series of anthologies. With frequent collaborator Larry Niven, he cowrote the genre-defining first contact novel <i>The Mote in God's Eye</i>, which was praised by Robert A. Heinlein as \"possibly the greatest science fiction novel I have ever read\". </p> <p>Now, for the first time, all of Pournelle's best short work has been collected in a single volume. Herein you will find over a dozen short stories, each with a new introduction by editor and longtime Pournelle assistant John F. Carr, as well as essays and remembrances by Pournelle collaborators and admirers.</p>";
