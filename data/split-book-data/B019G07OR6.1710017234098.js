window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Dhalgren</i>, perhaps one of the most profound and best-selling science fiction novels of all time, Samuel R. Delany has produced a novel that rivals the best American fiction of the 1970s. </p> <p>Bellona is a city at the dead center of the United States. Something has happened there...the population has fled. Madmen and criminals wander the streets. Strange portents appear in the cloud-covered sky. And into this disaster zone comes a young man - a poet, a lover, and an adventurer - known only as the Kid. </p> <p>Tackling questions of race, gender, and sexuality, <i>Dhalgren</i> is a literary marvel and a groundbreaking work of American magical realism. </p>";
