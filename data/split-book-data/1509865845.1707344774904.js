On the world they called Nod, scientists discovered alien life – but it was their mission to overwrite it with the memory of Earth. Then humanity’s great empire fell, and the program’s decisions were lost to time.<br> <br> Aeons later, humanity and its new spider allies detected fragmentary radio signals between the stars. They dispatched an exploration vessel, hoping to find cousins from old Earth.<br> <br> But those ancient terraformers woke something on Nod better left undisturbed.<br> <br> And it’s been waiting for them.</p>";
