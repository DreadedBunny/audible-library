Have you ever thought that the whole universe might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? If you have, then you've had hints of the Change War.</p> <p>It's been going on for a billion years, and it will last another billion or so. Up and down the timeline, the two sides, \"Spiders\" and \"Snakes\", battle endlessly to change the future and the past. Our lives and our memories are their battleground. And in the midst of the war is the Place, outside space and time, where Greta Forzane and the other Entertainers provide solace and R&amp;R for tired time warriors.</p> <p>Fritz Leiber was one of the most important sci-fi and fantasy writers of the 20th century. <i>The Big Time</i>, which won a Hugo Award for Best Novel, is his most famous SF novel.</p>";
