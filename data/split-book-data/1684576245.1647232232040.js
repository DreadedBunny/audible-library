window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of <i>Living the Secular Life</i> deconstructs the arguments for a morality informed by religion, urging that major challenges like global warming and growing inequality are best approached from a framework of secular morality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>What It Means to Be Moral: Why Religion Is Not Necessary for Living an Ethical Life</i>, Phil Zuckerman argues that morality does not come from God. Rather, it comes from us: our brains, our evolutionary past, our ongoing cultural development, our social experiences, and our ability to reason, reflect, and be sensitive to the suffering of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>By deconstructing religious arguments for God-based morality and guiding listeners through the premises and promises of secular morality, Zuckerman argues that the major challenges facing the world today - from global warming and growing inequality to religious support for unethical political policies to gun violence and terrorism - are best approached from a nonreligious ethical framework. In short, we need to look to our fellow humans and within ourselves for moral progress and ethical action.</p>";
