In the 1900s, a Zepellin explores an icy canyon in Antarctica. In the far future, a&nbsp;spaceship sets out for an alien artifact. Each excursion goes horribly wrong. And on every journey, Dr. Silas Coade is the physician, but only Silas seems to realize that these events keep repeating themselves. And it's up to him to figure out why and how. And how to stop it all from happening again.</p>";
