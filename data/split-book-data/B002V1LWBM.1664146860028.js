window.bookSummaryJSON = "Vernor Vinge doesn't write novels very quickly, but when he writes one, it's well worth the wait. His last two novels have won the coveted Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the year. <i>Rainbows End</i> is set in the same near future as his novella \"Fast Times at Fairmont High\", which won the Hugo Award in 2002 for Best Novella. Set a few decades from now, <i>Rainbows End</i> is an epic adventure that encapsulates in a single extended family the challenges of the technological advances of the first quarter of the 21st century. The information revolution of the past 30 years blossoms into a web of conspiracies that could destroy Western civilization. At the center of the action is Robert Gu, a former Alzheimer's victim who has regained his mental and physical health through radical new therapies, and his family. His son and daughter-in-law are both in the military, but not a military we would recognize, while his middle-school-age granddaughter is involved in perhaps the most dangerous game of all, with people and forces more powerful than she or her parents can imagine. <p>Filled with excitement and Vinge's trademark potpourri of fascinating ideas, <i>Rainbows End</i> is another triumphantly entertaining novel by one of the true masters of the field.</p>";
