It is set in the same universe, with a new cast of characters and a thrilling new narrative.</p> <p>It has been waiting through the ages. Now it's time....</p> <p>Thousands of years ago, Earth’s terraforming program took to the stars. On the world they called Nod, scientists discovered alien life – but it was their mission to overwrite it with the memory of Earth. Then humanity’s great empire fell and the program’s decisions were lost to time.</p> <p>Aeons later, humanity and its new spider allies detected fragmentary radio signals between the stars. They dispatched an exploration vessel, hoping to find cousins from old Earth.</p> <p>But those ancient terraformers woke something on Nod better left undisturbed.</p> <p>And it’s been waiting for them.</p>";
