window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Locus Award winner, 2016</b></p> <p><b>Breq and her crew must stand against an old and powerful enemy and fight for their own destinies in the stunning conclusion to the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling trilogy. A must read for fans of Ursula K. Le Guin and James S. A. Corey.</b></p> <p>For a moment, things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who shouldn't exist, and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as does Breq's enemy, the divided and quite possibly insane Anaander Mianaai—ruler of an empire at war with itself.</p> <p>Breq refuses to flee with her ship and crew, because that would leave the people of Athoek in terrible danger. The odds aren't good, but that's never stopped her before.</p> <p><b>\"There are few who write science fiction like Ann Leckie can. There are few who ever could.\"—John Scalzi</b></p>";
