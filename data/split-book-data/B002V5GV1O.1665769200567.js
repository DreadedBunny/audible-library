window.bookSummaryJSON = "David Brin's Uplift novels are among the most thrilling, highly regarded works of contemporary science fiction. Beginning with <i>Sundiver</i>, Brin provides an intriguing exploration of humanity's future in the universe. <p>For nearly a billion years, every known sentient species in the universe has been the result of genetic and cultural guidance - or \"uplifting\" - by a previously uplifted patron race. Then humans are discovered. Having already uplifted chimps and dolphins, humanity clearly qualifies as an intelligent species, but did they actually evolve their own intelligence, or did some mysterious patron race begin the process, then suddenly abandon Earth? The answer to this mystery might be as close as our own sun, but it will take a daring dive into its fiery interior to know for sure.</p> <p> <i>Sundiver</i> begins David Brin's thoughtful, exhilarating exploration of a future filled with an imaginative array of strange alien races, dazzling scientific achievements, and age-old enigmas.</p>";
