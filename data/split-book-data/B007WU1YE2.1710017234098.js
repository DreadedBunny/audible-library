window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Science Fiction, 2013</b></p> <p></p> <p>Admiral John \"Black Jack\" Geary earned his rank after being revived from cryogenic sleep to lead the Alliance to victory against the Syndicate Worlds. But his superiors question his loyalty to the regime. Now in command of the First Fleet, Geary is tasked with exploring the frontier beyond Syndic space, a mission he fears deliberately puts the fleet - and himself - in harm's way. </p> <p>An encounter with the alien enigmas confirms Geary's fears. Attacked without warning, he orders the fleet to jump star systems - only to enter the crosshairs of another hostile alien armada. Ignoring all of the First Fleet's attempts to communicate peaceful intentions, this system's species sends its ships into battle on suicide runs while it guards the exiting jump point with a fortress of incalculable power. </p> <p>Now, with a faction of his officers determined to eliminate this new threat at any cost, Geary must figure out how to breach the enemy's defenses so the fleet can reach the jump point without massive casualties - even though the enigmas could be waiting on the other side. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction written and read by author Jack Campbell.</b></p>";
