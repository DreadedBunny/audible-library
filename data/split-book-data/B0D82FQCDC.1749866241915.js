window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A tale of transcendence, </b><b><i>Downward to the Earth</i></b><b> is a remarkable novel from one of the most imaginative minds in science fiction.</b></p> <p>Edmund Gunderson—former Terran governor of the colony world of Belzagor—returns eight years after the planet has gained independence, drawn back for reasons he can’t quite explain. Things have changed significantly since he left, and he plays his part well—slightly pompous former government official—for the tourists he encounters on the way down.</p> <p>But this is more than a simple sight-seeing visit. As Gunderson comes face-to-face with the consequences of his former attitudes and actions, he finds himself on a journey—both physical and spiritual—to the legendary mountain of rebirth.</p>";
